- move global vs. illumination to scope binding time
-- scope to local illumination (stick to what is familiar)
- this project is combo SRS and CA
-- add instance models (figure out how to put assumptions earlier and repeat abstractions with more detail later)
- make more decisions to scope
- single goal statement GS1
- Specular is TM - diffuse is GD
- make more decisions about variabilities (objects, more about light sources, observer, scene)
-- be specific about how these things are stored
-- consider things like coordinates (show that it could be many things and then make assumption and scope)
