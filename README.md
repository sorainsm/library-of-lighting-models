# Lights, Camera, Models!
Study of light modeling as a physics problem, with the purpose of implementing of a family of lighting models through a library.
Finalized as a WebGL implementation that can be used to visualize the effects of changing material properties, lighting models, and light positions and types. Try it out at : https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~sorainsm/projects/index.html
